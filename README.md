# Shaders-on-raspberry-pi4

Download the whole repo on the pi4.

Open the folder Shaders-on-raspberry-pi4 and open any of the examples in the Ex_name folders.

Open the .py file (run_shader_w_downscale.py) in Geany and click run.

The code looks for the name and location of the shader... like:
shader = pi3d.Shader("shaders/nameofshader")  # this runs the shader called nameofshader.fs and nameofshader.vs in shaders folder
shader = pi3d.Shader("nameofshader")  # this runs the shader called nameofshader.fs and nameofshader.vs

You can paste pi4 compatible shader code in the nameofshader.fs file -> can be generated by this tool
(or you can change the necessary variables manually :D ):

NOTE: 
Currently only fragment shaders (.fs files) are implemented.
You can delete the work-in-progress folder. I use that for experiments, they are not guaranteed to work.

Thank you to Paddy Gaunt (@paddywwoof) for excellent help and advice on implementing this.


## Dependencies

Make sure to install the pi3D library or the code will not run.
Just doing the following worked on a Pi 4 w/ 1 Gb RAM. which was running the newest verision of Raspberry Pi OS.
The Pi OS was installed using the Raspberry Pi Imager (for mac) https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/.

The following steps are based on https://pi3d.github.io/html/ReadMe.html#setup-on-the-raspberry-pi.

### In terminal:

$ sudo pip3 install pi3d

$ sudo raspi-config

Then set gpu_mem=128 under -> advanced options -> memory split

The last line is to increase the GPU memory, this is default set to 64.
You want to set it higher to 128.

## ABOUT pi3d

The pi3d library comes with many other demo examples... I'm only focusing on shaders!

You can download all of the other demos, but it is not necessary for running my shader examples. 
You can also start coding pi3d right away (here is a getting started tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXTU6x8dQJw&feature=youtu.be)

This is how to download the demos (Steps based on https://pi3d.github.io/html/ReadMe.html#setup-on-the-raspberry-pi):

### In terminal:

$ wget https://github.com/pi3d/pi3d_demos/archive/master.zip

$ unzip master.zip

$ rm master.zip

$ mv pi3d_demos-master pi3d_demos



To run them ALL through and test that it works, do:

$ cd ~/pi3d_demos

$ python3 RunTests.py

Otherwise just open the nameOfFile.py in Thonny and click Run.

I did not make pi3d.
